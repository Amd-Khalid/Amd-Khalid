### 🚀 What I’m Working On

* **Frontend Engineering:** Crafting responsive, high-performance web interfaces using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.
* **Machine Learning & Data Science:** Analyzing large-scale datasets (up to 100k+ rows) and building predictive models with **Python and scikit-learn**.
* **Mobile Development:** Building robust Android applications with **Kotlin and Jetpack Compose** using modern **MVVM architecture**.

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

* **[Fitness Tracking App](https://github.com/Amd-Khalid)**
* A full-stack Android app for tracking routines and nutrition. [cite_start]Implemented persistent offline storage with **Room DB** and reduced UI code duplication by 40% through modular **Jetpack Compose** components.
* **[AI-Powered PacMan](https://github.com/Amd-Khalid)**
* A ground-up rebuild in **C++ and SDL2** featuring realistic ghost behavior powered by the **$A^{*}$ pathfinding algorithm**. Structured into 8+ independent modules for rendering, physics, and state logic.
* **[Data Science & ML Pipelines](https://github.com/Amd-Khalid)**
End-to-end analysis of real-world datasets using **pandas and NumPy**. Developed NLP pipelines and regression/classification models achieving up to **88% accuracy**.
